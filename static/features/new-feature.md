# New Features

Hi! This page is the first announcement for feature notifications. From now on, every release or bug fix will show up here with a short summary and any relevant links.

## What to expect

- A quick overview of what changed
- Helpful context for why it matters
- Links to follow-up documentation when available

## How it works

When we ship an update, a notification is generated and added to this feed. You can open any item to read the details in full. We’ll keep entries concise and action-oriented so it’s easy to scan.

If you have feedback on how these notifications should look or what details you want included, let us know and we’ll iterate.
